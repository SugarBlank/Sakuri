<h4>What is the Account ID?</h4>
<p>
The Account ID is a unique identifier for every account on Sokaneri, by using the Account ID you do not need to provide any email, phone number, or other personal information. It is highly suggested to store the Account ID in a secure area, since it's the only identifier Sokaneri uses, and once it's gone it's lost it's lost for good.
